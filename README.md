# OW-Scrapper
Python goodness to scrape data from the Operation World website into a easy to use JSON


## Roadmap:

Return OW country page as JSON
Example page: http://www.operationworld.org/country/afgh/owtext.html

Save page to a cache to prevent hitting the OW page too often

Add access tokens

Map OW country codes to two letter ISO standards
